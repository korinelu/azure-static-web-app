üìù Project Report: CI/CD Pipeline for Static Website with Azure Static Web Apps & GitHub Actions
1. Introduction
This project showcases a modern DevOps implementation using GitHub Actions and Azure Static Web Apps to deploy a static website. The goal was to build an end-to-end automated pipeline that takes source code from a GitHub repository and deploys it directly to Azure upon each push to the main branch. This reflects a production-grade approach to continuous delivery for front-end or documentation-based applications.

2. Abstract
A simple HTML-based static website was created and placed inside the app/ directory. Using Azure Static Web Apps‚Äô native integration with GitHub, a deployment pipeline was auto-configured through GitHub Actions. This setup allows for:

Automated deployments on code changes

Seamless integration with GitHub

Hosting via Microsoft‚Äôs cloud infrastructure

The pipeline deploys the website with every push to main, and credentials are securely managed using Azure Deployment Tokens.

3. Tools & Technologies Used

Tool/Service	Purpose
GitHub Actions	CI/CD orchestration
Azure Static Web Apps	Static site hosting & deployment
HTML + CSS	Static website content
Git	Version control
VS Code	Code editing
Azure Portal	Web app setup & token management

5. Deployment Workflow
Static Site: Basic HTML file located in app/index.html

GitHub Workflow: Auto-generated by Azure during Static Web App creation

Trigger: Push to the main branch

Deployment Token: 
The AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN was automatically generated by Azure during the Static Web App creation process. Since GitHub was selected as the deployment source, Azure seamlessly added this token to the GitHub repository‚Äôs Secrets for use in the CI/CD workflow. This eliminated the need for manual token creation and simplified the authentication process.

6. Azure Configuration
Azure Static Web App was created using the Azure Portal.

App location was set to app (contains index.html)

Deployment Token was generated and securely added to GitHub Secrets.

7. Output
‚úÖ Upon push, the GitHub Action triggers the workflow and deploys the updated site to Azure.
üí¨ Final Website Message:

Welcome to the Static Website hosted on Azure!
This is a simple site deployed using GitHub Actions and Azure Static Web Apps.

8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates a clean and effective way to implement DevOps practices for frontend/static sites using Azure Static Web Apps. It involves version control, automation, and secure deployment without requiring traditional virtual machines or container services ‚Äî making it ideal for static content or front-end hosting.
